# Bonar-oú? ¿Cuando 'roonamos?

Printable (12" x 18") Bonnaroo 2023 schedule and maps.

# Acknowledgements

@nwself said we need these and that the interwebs are all in a tizzy because they're not being printed any more (and that we really want one too).

Thanks to Bonnie Lads @nwself and @specialorange for helping me to my first(?) Bonnaroo.

Thanks to [r/bonnaroo](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo)'s [u/Ender112](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ender112/) for making [the schedules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/13ff1p3/centeroo_and_outeroo_schedules_combined_for_your/). (but like R.I.P. reddit I guess 🤷‍♂️?)

Thanks to these folks for the qrcode https://www.qr-code-generator.com/

s/o to JMU PrintServices (this job paid personally, no worries) and their Brian Sampson for help with Printing! 🙌
